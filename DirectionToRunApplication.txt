--- About the API

1) This solution is built on .Net core web API version 6.0.0200

2) Unit test project is built on the same version

3) This application adheres to the assignment on the link https://github.com/ParcelVision/SLMM/blob/master/server-side-dev-test.md

4) The aim of the API is make a lawn mower move in a rectangular field with assumption that there is only one lawn mower in the field

--- How to load the application

1) Download or clone the application
2) Check you have visual studio installed on your machine
2) Make sure to open the application in visual studio 2022 as lower versions do not support .Net core 6.0.
3) If you do not have enterprise or professional version of visual studio 2022, feel free to download the community version. This is 
a very simple project which which run nicely even in community edition

-- How to Run the application

1) Once the application is opened in visual studio, Rebuild the project using the build menu option in top menu bar.
2) Select SLMM and not SLMMTests as the start up application
3) Run the application from the second menu bar
4) The swagger is incorporated to make the API calls designed
5) The swagger page should open automatically but if there is a firewall issue, go to the below url in the browser selected while 
running the app :- https://localhost:7029/swagger/index.html

-- Assumption while running the api calls
1) For the reset api "SetAreaOfFieldAndResetSLMM", It will set the dimension of the fiels to length and breadth provided.
2) It will also place the lown mower to (0,0) position facing northward as expected. 
3) This means when the application starts or is reset the lown mower x and y axis position is 0 and it is facing northward
4) For the SLMM movement api "MoveLawnMower", we expect the input in the form of integer. This integer is translated into the commands as below :- 

0 :- Rotate clockwise
1 :- Rotate Anti-clockwise
2 :- Move forward

5) For any other integer other than 1,2,3 the api throws a proper exception message asking to enter either 1,2 or 3 and their corresponsing meaning
6) The instruction input is designed with the expectation that when the front-end for the api is designed, it will take the input selection
from use and change it to corresponding integer from instruction enum in the front-end which adheres to the enum in backend.
7) If at any position, the SLMM goes is to go out of the lawn due to further forward movement, the api thrown an exception signifying 
the direction in which the SLMM was moving and further movement is not possible.


--- How to run unit tests

1) Code coverage has been ensured to cover all scenarios. To run the unit tests, in the top menu bar select Test -> Run All Tests
2) Alternativelt you can go to Test -> Test Explorer and dock it on the window and the either run all tests or run one of them


--- Further work that could be done

1) Get exception in proper format like problem details json specification instead of just throw an exception
2) Develop a simple UI which takes instruction in a proper format from user and calls API with integer values
3) Instead of Thread.Sleep, use some implementation of async/await
